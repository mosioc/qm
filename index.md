## Summary
Entangled Photons are a critical phenomenon in quantum mechanics, where pairs of photons become linked in such a way that the measurement of one photon instantly influences the state of the other, irrespective of the distance between them.[(1)](#ref1)[(2)](#ref2) This unique property forms the basis of various quantum information technologies, enabling advancements in secure communication methods, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.[(3)](#ref3)[(4)](#ref4) The significance of entangled photons lies not only in their theoretical implications but also in their practical applications, which are revolutionizing fields such as telecommunications and information security.

The generation of entangled photons has garnered substantial attention, particularly through methods like Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM) and the utilization of quantum dots containing biexcitons. SFWM is notable for its compatibility with semiconductor technologies, facilitating on-chip entangled photon sources, while quantum dots enable efficient photon pair production, enhancing the overall yield of entangled states.[(1)](#ref1)[(2)](#ref2) These advancements are integral to the development of robust quantum communication networks capable of maintaining security against potential eavesdropping, leveraging principles like the no-cloning theorem and superposition.[(3)](#ref3)

In addition to communication, entangled photons play a pivotal role in quantum computing and the broader field of quantum information science. By facilitating entanglement swapping and establishing long-distance quantum links, they are instrumental in creating a new generation of quantum-enabled technologies. The shift from classical bits to quantum bits (qubits) heralds transformative changes across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and data processing.[(3)](#ref3)[(4)](#ref4)

Controversies in this domain often arise from the philosophical implications of quantum entanglement, particularly regarding its challenges to classical notions of locality and causality. Moreover, debates persist regarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics itself, with implications for understanding the fundamental nature of reality.[(4)](#ref4)[(5)](#ref5) Overall, the study of entangled photons and their applications is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field, promising to reshape our technological landscape while challenging our understanding of the universe.


## Entangled Photons
Photon entanglement is a remarkable phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more photons become intertwined in such a way that the quantum state of each photon cannot be described independently, regardless of the distance separating them[(1)](#ref1)[(2)](#ref2). This property, which Einstein famously referred to as "spooky action at a distance," is a fundamental aspect of quantum information science, underpinning various applications such as secure quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation[(3)](#ref3)[(4)](#ref4).

The mathematical representation of an entangled state of two photons with polarization can be written as:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H\rangle_1|V\rangle_2 - |V\rangle_1|H\rangle_2)
$$

Where $|H\rangle$ and $|V\rangle$ represent horizontal and vertical polarization states respectively.

### Generation of Entangled Photons
One of the prominent techniques for generating entangled photons is Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM), which is particularly advantageous due to its material versatility and potential for on-chip integration through semiconductor fabrication technologies[(1)](#ref1). SFWM allows for the creation of hyperentangled states on a chip, which are beneficial for quantum communication systems. Additionally, photon pairs can be emitted from quantum dots loaded with biexcitons, where two electrons and two holes are present[(3)](#ref3)[(2)](#ref2). This method has gained significant attention in recent years, enhancing the efficiency of entangled photon generation.

### Applications in Quantum Technologies
Entangled photons play a crucial role in the advancement of quantum technologies. They are essential for establishing long-distance quantum communication, which relies on creating entanglement across remote nodes[(3)](#ref3). Techniques such as entanglement swapping enable this by allowing independent nodes to become entangled through Bell state measurements[(4)](#ref4). The peculiar properties of entanglement also facilitate secure communication protocols, reducing vulnerabilities to eavesdropping and hacking by leveraging quantum phenomena like the no-cloning theorem and superposition principle[(3)](#ref3)[(2)](#ref2).

Furthermore, the emergence of quantum information science heralds a new era of quantum-enabled information technology where traditional bits are replaced with quantum bits or qubits. This shift is poised to revolutionize various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and telecommunications[(3)](#ref3). The continued research and innovation in the field of entangled photons and their generation methods are integral to unlocking the full potential of quantum communication and computation technologies.

### Applications in Quantum Communication
Entangled photons are essential for on-demand quantum communication. As triggered sources, quantum dots have been successfully integrated into quantum communication systems, evidenced by a notable 2021 field test that achieved entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) over a 350-meter fiber link, yielding a secure key rate of 86 bits/s without active polarization stabilization[(2)](#ref2). This test demonstrated the practical viability of QD sources in real-world environments and suggests the potential for scaling key rates to gigabits per second with further advancements in technology.

### Quantum Properties and Theoretical Foundations
The phenomenon of entanglement raises profound questions about the nature of reality and has been a topic of extensive theoretical exploration, including the famous EPR paradox introduced by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935, which highlighted the non-local properties of entangled states[(2)](#ref2)[(12)](#ref12). In quantum information theory, entangled states serve as a vital resource, enabling a range of operations that classical systems cannot perform, such as facilitating secure communication and enhancing computational power[(9)](#ref9)[(10)](#ref10).

### Challenges and Advances
Despite the promising applications of entangled photons, there are several practical challenges in their generation and manipulation. Issues such as cross-talk in quantum circuits, complexity of control systems, and maintaining high fidelity in entangled states pose significant hurdles[(2)](#ref2). Nevertheless, ongoing research continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, including recent achievements in creating large-scale entangled states and enhancing the robustness of quantum systems against decoherence[(11)](#ref11).


## Quantum Dot
Quantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor particles that exhibit unique optical and electronic properties due to their size and dimensional confinement. A quantum dot can be considered as a three-dimensional "particle in a box," where the confinement of charge carriers, such as electrons and holes, occurs in all three dimensions[(5)](#ref5). In contrast, quantum wires and quantum wells confine particles in lower dimensions, allowing for distinct electronic behavior and applications.

The energy levels in a quantum dot can be approximated by the particle-in-a-box model, with energy eigenvalues:

$$
E_{n_x,n_y,n_z} = \frac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2m}\left(\frac{n_x^2}{L_x^2}+\frac{n_y^2}{L_y^2}+\frac{n_z^2}{L_z^2}\right)
$$

Where:
$$ n_x $$
$$n_y$$
and
$$n_z$$
are quantum numbers, and
$$L_x$$
$$L_y$$
and $$L_z$$
are the dimensions of the confinement region.

### Applications of Quantum Dots

#### Energy Storage and Charging
Recent advancements have demonstrated that quantum dots made from iron pyrite can facilitate rapid charging in modern devices, such as smartphones. Researchers at Vanderbilt University found that these quantum dots enable a full charge in just 30 seconds, significantly enhancing charging efficiency and longevity over multiple cycles[(4)](#ref4). This application showcases the potential of quantum dots in revolutionizing energy storage technologies.

#### Solar Energy Conversion
Quantum dots play a crucial role in solar energy applications. When exposed to sunlight, they absorb energy and generate excitons, which are pairs of bound electrons and holes. Efficient separation of these charge carriers is essential for generating electric current; electrons travel to the photoanode via metal oxide nanorods, while holes are transferred to the electrolyte. This process enhances the efficiency of solar cells by expanding the absorption spectrum and improving charge separation dynamics[(5)](#ref5).

#### Quantum Computing
Quantum dots are regarded as promising candidates for solid-state quantum computing. By applying a small voltage across the quantum dot, researchers can manipulate electron flow, allowing for precise measurements of quantum properties like spin. This capability supports the creation of qubits using entangled quantum dots, which could provide solutions to challenges in quantum computing[(2)](#ref2)[(6)](#ref6).

#### Medical Imaging
In the field of medical diagnostics, quantum dots can be utilized as fluorescent markers. Researchers have developed latex beads filled with quantum dot nanocrystals that bind to specific DNA sequences. These probes can emit distinct wavelengths and intensities of light when stimulated by ultraviolet light, enabling the identification of specific regions within DNA. This technology has significant implications for cancer research and other medical applications, enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of genetic analysis[(6)](#ref6).


## Biexciton
Biexcitons are bound states formed by two excitons in a semiconductor, representing a key aspect of excitonic physics and contributing significantly to quantum optics and information science. They can be understood as composite particles resulting from the pairing of two electron-hole pairs (excitons) through Coulombic interactions. The formation of biexcitons typically occurs in semiconductor nanocrystals, where the spatial confinement and interaction of charge carriers enhance the coupling between excitons.

The binding energy of a biexciton can be expressed as:

$$
E_B = E_{XX} - 2E_X
$$

Where $E_{XX}$ is the biexciton energy and $E_X$ is the exciton energy.

### Formation and Properties
Biexcitons are generally formed under conditions of high excitation density, where two excitons can be created in close proximity. The binding energy of a biexciton is usually greater than the sum of the binding energies of two individual excitons, which leads to unique optical properties. For instance, the energy difference between the biexciton state and the ground state is characterized by a spectral signature that is distinct from that of single excitons. This phenomenon has been explored in various studies involving quantum dots and semiconductor nanocrystals, revealing that biexcitons exhibit a range of emission energies that can be tuned based on the size and composition of the nanocrystals[(7)](#ref7)[(8)](#ref8).

### Quantum Optics Applications
Biexcitons have significant implications in quantum optics, particularly in the context of entangled photon generation. The decay of a biexciton can lead to the emission of two entangled photons, which are crucial for applications in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. This process leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, thereby allowing for the creation of high-fidelity entangled states that can be harnessed for secure information transfer[(9)](#ref9)[(10)](#ref10).

Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of utilizing biexcitons in liquid crystals and other novel materials to enhance the efficiency of photon generation. These innovations not only promise to improve the yield of entangled photons but also offer greater control over their quantum states, paving the way for further developments in quantum technologies[(11)](#ref11).


## Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It is renowned for its counterintuitive principles, which challenge classical mechanics and have profound implications for our understanding of the universe.

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation, which governs the evolution of quantum systems, is given by:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

Where:
$$\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$
is the wave function,
$$\hat{H}$$
is the Hamiltonian operator, and
$$\hbar$$
is the reduced Planck constant.

### Fundamental Concepts
At the core of quantum mechanics is the concept of the quantum state, which encapsulates all the information about a system. The basic unit of quantum information is the qubit, analogous to a classical bit but capable of existing in a superposition of states. This allows qubits to represent multiple values simultaneously, leading to the potential for quantum computation that far exceeds classical capabilities[(11)](#ref11)[(7)](#ref7).

### Wave-Particle Duality
One of the most striking features of quantum mechanics is wave-particle duality, exemplified by photons. Photons, as described by Albert Einstein, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is essential in understanding phenomena such as interference and diffraction, and it underpins the behavior of light in quantum optics[(11)](#ref11)[(12)](#ref12).

### Entanglement
Entanglement is another fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, wherein the states of two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others, regardless of the distance separating them. This non-local connection has been experimentally confirmed and is pivotal for quantum communication technologies, such as quantum cryptography and teleportation[(13)](#ref13)[(4)](#ref4).

### Quantum Theories and Applications
The theoretical framework of quantum mechanics includes various interpretations and mathematical formulations, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, many-worlds interpretation, and the path integral formulation. Quantum mechanics has led to significant advancements in technology, including lasers, semiconductors, and quantum computing, driving ongoing research in fields such as quantum information processing and quantum optics[(14)](#ref14)[(6)](#ref6)[(15)](#ref15).


## Quantum and Energy
The relationship between quantum mechanics and energy is fundamental to understanding the behavior of particles at the quantum level, where energy exists in discrete packets rather than continuous flows.

### Energy Quantization
One of the cornerstone principles of quantum mechanics is that energy is quantized—occurring only in discrete amounts or quanta. This concept, first proposed by Max Planck to explain blackbody radiation, revolutionized physics by challenging the classical notion of continuous energy. In quantum systems such as atoms and molecules, electrons can only occupy specific energy levels and must absorb or emit precise amounts of energy to transition between these states. This quantization explains phenomena like atomic spectra, where atoms emit or absorb light at characteristic frequencies corresponding to energy-level transitions[(11)](#ref11)[(5)](#ref5).

For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by:

$$
E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right), \quad n=0,1,2,...
$$

Where
$$\omega$$
is the angular frequency and
$$n$$
is the quantum number.

### Zero-Point Energy
Even at absolute zero temperature, quantum systems retain a residual energy known as zero-point energy, a direct consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This phenomenon indicates that particles can never be completely at rest, maintaining minimum energy fluctuations. Zero-point energy has significant implications for quantum field theory and vacuum energy considerations, potentially contributing to the cosmological constant and the expansion of the universe[(7)](#ref7)[(12)](#ref12).

The zero-point energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is:

$$
E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega
$$


## Quantum and Momentum
The concept of momentum in quantum mechanics differs substantially from its classical counterpart, introducing probabilistic distributions and wave-like properties.

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle establishes a fundamental limit to the precision with which complementary variables, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. Mathematically expressed as ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2, this principle is not merely a limitation of measurement technology but a profound statement about the nature of quantum reality. It implies that the more precisely we know a particle's position, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa. This principle has far-reaching consequences for quantum measurements and the deterministic limitations of quantum systems[(13)](#ref13)[(4)](#ref4).

The mathematical formulation of the uncertainty principle for position and momentum is:

$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

### De Broglie Wavelength
Louis de Broglie's hypothesis that all matter exhibits wave-like properties established the concept of matter waves with a wavelength inversely proportional to momentum (λ = h/p). This wave-particle duality has been experimentally confirmed for particles ranging from electrons to large molecules, demonstrating interference patterns characteristic of waves. The de Broglie wavelength is crucial for understanding electron behavior in atoms, quantum tunneling phenomena, and the design of electron microscopes[(11)](#ref11)[(8)](#ref8).

The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is related to its momentum by:

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}
$$

Where
$$h$$
is Planck's constant,
$$p$$
is momentum,
$$m$$
is mass, and
$$v$$
is velocity.


## Quantum and Angular Momentum
Angular momentum in quantum mechanics is quantized and exhibits unique properties that differ from classical rotational motion.

### Spin
Spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles, having no classical analog. Unlike classical rotation, quantum spin is a fundamental property that exists even for point-like particles with no spatial extent. Particles like electrons possess a fixed spin value (½ for electrons), which can be oriented in specific directions relative to a measurement axis. Spin plays a critical role in the Pauli exclusion principle, atomic structure, and the behavior of fermions and bosons. It also underpins technologies such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and forms the basis for spintronic devices[(9)](#ref9)[(10)](#ref10).

For a spin-1/2 particle like an electron, the spin angular momentum magnitude is:

$$
|\mathbf{S}| = \sqrt{s(s+1)}\hbar = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}\hbar
$$

And the z-component can take values:

$$
S_z = m_s\hbar = \pm\frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

### Orbital Angular Momentum
Orbital angular momentum in quantum systems, such as electrons in atoms, is quantized and determined by quantum numbers. Unlike classical orbital motion, quantum orbital angular momentum is characterized by discrete allowed values and specific spatial distributions described by spherical harmonics. This quantization explains atomic spectra features and the stability of electron configurations in atoms. Additionally, photons can carry orbital angular momentum, which has applications in optical communications and quantum information processing[(14)](#ref14)[(6)](#ref6).

The orbital angular momentum of electrons in atoms is quantized:

$$
|\mathbf{L}| = \sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar
$$

And the z-component:

$$
L_z = m_l\hbar, \quad m_l = -l, -l+1, ..., l-1, l
$$


## Energy and Frequency
The relationship between energy and frequency is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, establishing a direct proportionality that governs photon behavior and wave-particle interactions.

### Planck-Einstein Relation
The Planck-Einstein relation, E = hν (where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and ν is frequency), establishes that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. This relationship, confirmed by the photoelectric effect, demonstrates that light with higher frequencies carries more energy per photon. This principle is essential for understanding light-matter interactions, including absorption and emission processes in atoms and molecules[(12)](#ref12)[(11)](#ref11).

The energy of a photon is related to its frequency by:

$$
E = h\nu = \hbar\omega
$$

Where $h$ is Planck's constant, $\nu$ is frequency, $\hbar = h/2\pi$, and $\omega = 2\pi\nu$ is angular frequency.

### Spectroscopy Applications
The energy-frequency relationship forms the basis of spectroscopic techniques used to probe matter's structure and composition. By analyzing the frequencies of light absorbed or emitted by substances, scientists can determine atomic and molecular energy levels, identify chemical compositions, and study quantum transitions. These applications extend to fields such as astronomy, where spectral analysis reveals the composition of distant celestial objects, and medical diagnostics, where specific frequency interactions are utilized for tissue analysis[(7)](#ref7)[(15)](#ref15).


## Probability Amplitudes
Probability amplitudes represent a mathematical framework for describing quantum states and the likelihood of measurement outcomes.

### Wave Functions
The wave function (typically denoted ψ) is a complex-valued probability amplitude that contains all the information about a quantum system's state. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the square of the wave function's absolute value (|ψ|²) gives the probability density for finding a particle at a specific position when measured. Wave functions evolve according to the Schrödinger equation and can represent superpositions of multiple states, allowing particles to exist in combinations of states simultaneously until measurement[(13)](#ref13)[(4)](#ref4).

The wave function must be normalized to ensure total probability equals 1:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
$$

For a particle in a one-dimensional box of length $L$, the normalized wave function is:

$$
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right), \quad n=1,2,3,...
$$

### Measurement and Collapse
The measurement process in quantum mechanics involves the apparent collapse of the wave function from a superposition to a definite state. This phenomenon, sometimes called wave function collapse, remains one of quantum mechanics' most discussed aspects, with various interpretations offering different explanations. The interaction between measurement apparatus and quantum systems leads to decoherence, which explains the emergence of classical behavior from quantum systems and addresses aspects of the measurement problem[(9)](#ref9)[(10)](#ref10).


## Quantum Electrodynamics
Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics, describing how light and matter interact at the quantum level.

### Light-Matter Interactions
QED explains fundamental electromagnetic interactions, such as how photons interact with charged particles like electrons. These interactions include absorption, emission, and scattering processes that are essential for understanding phenomena ranging from the photoelectric effect to chemical bonding. QED accounts for quantum effects like vacuum polarization and the Lamb shift, which reveal the influence of virtual particles and quantum fluctuations on observable physics[(6)](#ref6)[(14)](#ref14). The QED Lagrangian can be expressed as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{QED}} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi
$$

Where
$$F_{\mu\nu}$$
is the electromagnetic field tensor and
$$\gamma^\mu$$
are the Dirac matrices.

### Feynman Diagrams
Feynman diagrams serve as a graphical representation of particle interactions in QED, depicting processes such as electron-photon scattering and pair production. These diagrams translate complex mathematical calculations into visual representations that track particle paths and interaction vertices. Each diagram corresponds to a term in a perturbative expansion of the quantum amplitude, allowing physicists to systematically calculate probabilities for different quantum processes. The success of Feynman diagrams in QED has led to their adoption across quantum field theories[(8)](#ref8)[(15)](#ref15). The scattering amplitude in QED can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{M} = \sum_{\text{diagrams}} \int \prod_i \frac{d^4p_i}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{i}{p_i^2 - m_i^2 + i\epsilon} \prod_j (-ie\gamma^\mu)
$$

## Born Rule
The Born Rule provides the connection between the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics and experimental observations.

### Probability Interpretation
Formulated by Max Born, this rule states that the probability of finding a quantum system in a particular state is equal to the square of the absolute value of the wave function (|ψ|²). This interpretation transformed quantum mechanics from a mathematical formalism to a predictive theory by establishing how abstract wave functions relate to measurable outcomes. The Born Rule addresses the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and forms the basis for calculating expectation values of observables[(11)](#ref11)[(7)](#ref7). Mathematically, the Born Rule can be expressed as:

$$
P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2
$$

For a general observable $\hat{A}$ with eigenstates $|a_i\rangle$ and eigenvalues $a_i$, the expectation value is:

$$
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \sum_i a_i |\langle a_i|\psi \rangle|^2
$$

### Experimental Validation
The Born Rule has been extensively validated through experiments ranging from electron diffraction patterns to quantum optics measurements. These validations confirm the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics and support the probabilistic interpretation of quantum phenomena. Recent experiments have tested the Born Rule in increasingly complex systems, including multi-particle entangled states, further reinforcing its foundational role in quantum theory[(12)](#ref12)[(8)](#ref8). The general form of measurement probability in quantum mechanics is:

$$
P(a_i) = |\langle a_i|\psi \rangle|^2 = \text{Tr}(\hat{P}_{a_i}\hat{\rho})
$$

Where $\hat{P}_{a_i}$ is the projection operator and $\hat{\rho}$ is the density matrix.

## Quantum Interference
Quantum interference occurs when probability amplitudes combine, leading to constructive or destructive interference patterns that have no classical analog. The interference of quantum states $|\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$ is described by:

$$
|\psi_1 + \psi_2|^2 = |\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2 + 2\text{Re}(\psi_1^*\psi_2)
$$

Where the cross-term $2\text{Re}(\psi_1^*\psi_2)$ represents the quantum interference effect.

### Double-Slit Experiment
The double-slit experiment provides the quintessential demonstration of quantum interference, where single particles such as electrons or photons create an interference pattern as if they were waves passing through both slits simultaneously. This experiment highlights the wave-particle duality central to quantum mechanics and shows that quantum particles explore multiple paths simultaneously. Modern variations of this experiment have confirmed interference effects with increasingly larger particles, exploring the boundary between quantum and classical behaviors[(9)](#ref9)[(13)](#ref13). The wave function for a particle passing through two slits can be written as:

$$
\psi(x) = \psi_1(x) + \psi_2(x)
$$

The resulting interference pattern has intensity proportional to:

$$
I(x) \propto |\psi(x)|^2 = |\psi_1(x)|^2 + |\psi_2(x)|^2 + 2|\psi_1(x)||\psi_2(x)|\cos(\delta\phi)
$$

Where
$$\delta\phi$$
is the phase difference between the two paths.

### Quantum Computing Applications
Quantum interference forms the basis for many quantum computing algorithms, allowing quantum bits (qubits) to explore multiple solution paths simultaneously. This property enables quantum computers to potentially solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Interference effects are harnessed in algorithms such as Grover's search algorithm and quantum phase estimation, which underpin applications ranging from database searching to quantum simulation of physical systems. The control and manipulation of quantum interference patterns remain central challenges in the development of practical quantum computers[(10)](#ref10)[(15)](#ref15).
